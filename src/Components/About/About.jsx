                I thoroughly enjoy creating compelling designs by following modern UI and UX design principles and applying them to my projects. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I'm most productive when i'm working with others, and have experience working within in a Srum using the Agile framework, where we worked together to deliver our product weekly to our client.
