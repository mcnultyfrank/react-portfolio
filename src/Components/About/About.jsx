                I thoroughly enjoy creating compelling designs by following modern UI and UX design principles and applying them to my projects. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I'm most productive when i'm working with others, and have experience working within in a Srum using the Agile framework, where we worked together to deliver our product weekly to our client.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I'm always looking to expand my repertoire of technologies. I'm currently learning about servless technology and the cloud.

                I love to travel and in 2019 went exploring around India and Nepal for 6 months.

                I'm also university graduate and have a 2:1 BSC from The University Of West of England in Audio and Music Technology, where I learned to develop electronic synthesisers in C and C++.
                <br></br>

                As well as coding, i'm absolutely obsessed about music and produce electronic music in Ableton Live, and DJ as a hobby on my Technics and  CDJs.
