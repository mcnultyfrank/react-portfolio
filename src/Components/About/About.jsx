                I'm a Software Developer and a graduate from _nology, where I completed a full-time 12-week course. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I thoroughly enjoy creating compelling designs by following modern UI and UX design principles and applying them to my projects. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I'm most productive when I'm working with others, and have experience using Agile project management methodologies such as SCRUM, which ensured that we were constantly shipping value to our clients.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I'm always looking to expand my repertoire of technologies. I'm currently learning about serverless technology and the cloud.

                  I love to travel and in 2019 went exploring around India and Nepal for 6 months.

                  <p>I'm also a University graduate and have a 2:1 BSC from The University Of West of England in Audio and Music Technology, where I learned to develop electronic synthesisers in C and C++.</p>
                  <br></br>
                  <p>As well as coding, I'm obsessed about music and produce electronic music in Ableton Live, and DJ as a hobby on my Technics and  CDJs.</p>
